
This image is intented to service as an introduction to digital forensics and image analysis. 
You can use any image analysis software, such as FTK or Encase, but this guide goes over Autopsy
https://www.sleuthkit.org/autopsy/
Download and install the windows version of Autopsy 
Create a new case and then add this image as a data source.
Autopsy will begin analysizing the image, this will take a while.
When it reaches about 40%, most of the files should be processed and you can begin these tasks.


This image simulates a windows device with a basic file structure and thousands of files.

It contains five challenges.

1. 	The owner of the drive has been known to pirate videos. What pirated movies/series are on this device?
	[search by files type for videos]
	(Easy)

2. 	Image scavenger hunt. Find Rick Astley, Professor Snape, an Error Message, 3 different nudes, 
	a woman in a green at a podium, a man in a suit with glasses, and the guys in white.
	Identify the people in the last three images.
	[search by file type for images or think where images might appear in a Windows file structure]
	[several files were deleted and/or have the wrong extension, but autopsy should still find them]
	(Fairly Easy)

3. 	Identify the owner of this drive. His name probably appears in some files. 
	Once you have his name identify his email address and as much personal information as possible.
	[The owner's name can be found in several places, but his personal info is probably in a document or something]
	(Intermediate)

4. 	A girl has been kidnapped, and her location is currently unknown. You're only hope of finding her 
	is searching through thousands of the kidnapper's emails for something that's formatted like an address. 
	But have no fear, regular expressions are here. Um... You do know how to use regex right?
	Inspired by XKCD #208.
	[Autopsy uses grep syntax, an address might be in this format: 123 State St. Compton, CA 12345]
	[the best thing to look regex is probably the city comma state code zip: city, ST 12345]
	(Advanced)

5. 	And finally as a meta challenge, find out what this drive's previous purpose was. 
	I got this drive a long while ago. Tell me where I got it from, what was on it, and why I got it. 
	[Hint: I got that drive several years ago]
	(Intermediate)
	
6.	There are several hints about how to solve the challenges, but they might be a little unreadable.
	The hidden sixth challenge is to find and decode all the hints. Good luck.
	[searching for hints might reveal something]
	(advanced)
	
Please don't cheat, but in case you're stumped

Some advice, do not try to look through all the files manually, especially the txt files.
Several thousand spam email messages from the SPAM Archive <http://untroubled.org/spam/> were used as filler.

CAL POLY FAST is the official Cal Poly Pomona student chapter of the High Technology Crime 
Investigation Association. We aim to expose students to Digital Forensics, Cyber Crime, and 
Cyber Security through knowledge development, hands-on workshops, and real world experiences.
CAL POLY FAST seeks to partner with outside organizations to gain donations and organize 
fundraising events to fund our annual operating budget. CAL POLY FAST seeks to hold events 
and activities for the purposes of studying Digital Forensics, Cyber Crime, and Cyber Security. 
Our goal is to promote the readiness of soon to be graduates while providing value to Cal Poly 
Pomona and ultimately to the industries we are engaged in.
